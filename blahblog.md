### 2024-03-08 07:40 - initial thoughts

a few weeks ago I went to look up something on the internet and I ended up finding out that the CEO of youtube was a woman. I didn't know that and never thought to look. at the time, I was finally integrating into "the spanish way" -- and their culture is notably "I'm gonna do it myself / m/ own way", so it follows that we tried to do gatunes completely ourselves, when I didn't even look to see if there were any others that we could partner up with. I didn't like the "jujas" way of negotiating (later, I call this mutual-back-scratching) style of making deals and stuff. a real actually good music player was a completely realisable thing to do -- but again (just like tuenti) -- was making gatunes a reality what I *really* wanted tto do? with hindsight now, I recognise, it wasn't. my entire spanish experience had been a waste of time essentially; and this one "missed oppotunity" is only one of prolly tens of really good opportunities. there were so many talented people around me, and I basically just wanted to do drugs.
	speaking of which, the reason why I'm writing this now is because I finally smoked the second-to-last hit before finally going straight-edge. I wanted to write about my thoughts, but I didn't want to put more of my emotional crap into the shake-sphere repository -- even thonugh, what I'm about to write mirrors a number of different difficulties (the black prince) that are similar to my own. anyway, I kinda want to leave the narrative stuff alone and just start getting technical. when I actually go straight-edge, I'll havve so much energy, I will *need* (or strongly want) to be creative in a technical capacity.
		it's like when the eyes focus straight forward, and why looking way off into the distance is so amazing: when the eyes look forward (for me), I loose a sense of my immediate surroundings (I have basically zero peripheral vision), so all I can see are the things in the distance, and (because they're so far away) they no longer have an angle to their edges -- in 3d it's called "orthographic projection", and so space and tim5 take on an other-worldly quaitty to them because there's no more perspective for me to judge distances spatially but it also has a temporal effect as well: everything appears now, and because I can see so much... to describe, imagine that I'm designing the "death star" sitting on this thing (cause it's hollywood it's prolly this giant metallic throne with flatscreens or something) and there's this massive object in front of m5: it's about as massive as the sun, but I can zoom in on different parts and see the work that's being done and how it's coming along and so fourth. the death star is kinda like the physical implementation of concepept in my head: notice how in normal perspective we can see a visual sequence going from nearest to farest, but in othrographic projection, it's impossible to see any sequence; what comes first is always visible and completely covers over everything else, and so deciding what is most cosest to manifestation is always the thing that can be seen in front of everything else.
	I have ideas on what I want to make -- but the thing is, I have to do it using modern operating systems and code -- which is extremely frustrating to use. I don't understand why I have such a difficult time trying to use software, because I seem to attract ---- something -- I dunno, but it's really difficult to use. I've yet to find a thing that actually works. so fighting with that is not likely what I want to do. at the moment, my thoughts on that are simple: I just don't care. I don't know how to make the things I want to make with the current way things go.
I know I sound really spanish when I say it this way, but *I want to do it*. I want to actually create the thing I want to make. I know there are a lot of things that I talk about which are really interesting projects for others to work on; which is why I've made everything of mine (all data related to this body, past present and future) to be in the public domain. I have so many ideas, the only way even a fraction of them could get done, is if others do them. however, apart from that I still have something that *I want to make*. I'll find the help that I want for the thing, and I'll do the whole CEO top-down thing to make it what *I want it to be*.
	I decided That since I have to go 2nd-ray top-down, I'm going to do it in a technical way. I have no other option than to do that (other than more drugs), because they won't let me actually become what I want to be. I want to find a way to make a system that's only-attraction, but they're forcing me to go 2nd-ray, so I will. how are they forcing me? I try to do things on my own and just find the things that are interesting to me -- which usually is something creative, like programming or talking to someone about a topic that I find interesting/attractive (I want to know more about it), but they're constantly blocking me from being creative and talking about things that are interesting to me, which means that I either have to continually retreat further into my mind (I lay on the floor doing nothing but floating in the ocean, or do drugs so I can do the same). I don't really have any way of getting anything that I'm attracting, so I have to start becoming assertive if anything is to be accomplished.
I know it sounds really funny to say that I have to "go assertive to become attractive", but that's how my brain works. so let me tell you a little bit about how it is to move: when I finally saw m/ MRI pictures, I finally understood how it's possible for me to move my left-side. the brain makes the opposite impulse to make the movement (left-hemisphere moves right side) -- so think of it like a pulley system where there's a wall and a weight on either side. if a rope is tied directly above the weight, it takes full power to lift the weight; however instead if a pulley is put in the above the wall -- and let's say the pulley had like 10 thousand sprockets or so, the opposite side can lift the weight effortlessly. it's kind of like a dynamic pulley thought, not a fixed number of sprockets, and so a higher frequency not only has the ability to lift more weight effortlessly, but also to pull the rope (which is the nervous system) faster and with more precision. essentially, the faster the brain's frequency, the stronger and more precise the movements are. well, my brain is turned quite to the side, and that's so a little part of my left(?) hemisphere is on the right side, which enables movement on my left-side. I think that small portion which has mmved over to the opposite side is generating all of the movement signals to make movement. I've literally had to "go assertive" (ie, move my LH over to the right) and use a symbolic (LH) system to make attractive movements (pull on the ropes).
this process of having to figure out how to do "the left thing, the right way" is what I've done all of my life. I don't intend to stop until I can get there. I know that it's a really bad thing to have my LH being assertive and sneaking into the RH side, and it's really bad, but I don't know much else.
	I've considered the flat-earth-idea to be an externalisation of my two hemispheres. I want it to be possible for me to actually be able to have a normal and enjoyable life, and to let them do their own thing -- but they're constantly trying to manipulate everything that I do (which makes sense, because if the hind and fore parts of my brain are what's doing the crossover, that's going to be the visual and will aspects that are pulling eachothers strings) -- cause I think it's actually possible to let them have their own domain where they can do all the stuff that they want to do, and not have it bothering me. I don't want to bother them, and I'm not trying to destroy their system -- just, they have to let me make what I want to make so that we can actually be on opposite sides.
I believe it's entirely possible that this entire problem is centred around the fact I have to be in their zone to be able to carry on a normal life. I can't be a hemiplegic, so I have to use that 2nd-ray RH side. I'm the one that's trying to make that possible, because there's obviously no way i"m ever going to get rid of them (and trying to defeat them would also be notably 2nd-ray), so I have to find a way to let them continue to exist. because they're the 2nd-rays, yet they're not actually looking for a mutually beneficial situation, I have to do them (only for a while) better than they do them. oh well...
so no, I'm not really all that interested in trying to get anyone to help me. in my experience over the years, the quickest way to sabotage something I want to make is to get corporations or money involved. no thank you. I'll figure it out my own way.
	I have many other reservations about anything regarding this. after noah gave me the swab thing, I was excited to get to "see" my DNA sequence. I get on the website, and there's all this crap about heredetary diseases. I downloaded my sequence and haven't returned to the website since. I don't care anything about diseases, and want nothing to do with any of that. the whole project is facing in a direction that feels really bad to m5. there are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MANY things that can be done with DNA, that I do not believe the kits should cost any money (also SOOOOOOOOOO MANY ways to m6netise it as well), that I just can't align with something like that. 23andme is a prime example of how corporations and money wreck something that cOuld be so good.
though, I do find it quite refreshing to write about the human body and how it works from my experience. I've had to essentially rebuild so many brain and body functions that most take completely for granted. it's actually quite impressive how the body is concept/hydrogen processing machine. all we do, all day long (and even while asleep) is manipulate the body's perception/vibration. understanding perception unlocks the body, because all of it is coming from those hydrogen vibratons in the brain, and everything is connected to it from urination/defication to eyesight, motion-detection and boundaries. so I'll probably continue to write here about those things: 23 (chromosomes -- though soon I'll have 25) and me :)
I'll probably try and rerender a lot of my previous genetics ideas into more cohesive form.
